Deep Ultrasound Denoising Using Diffusion Probabilistic Models

A. CIFAR10 dataset [12]
The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 60000 images in 10 classes, each having 6000 color images of size 32x32. The dataset has been separated into 50000 training and 10000 test images. The dataset is divided into six batches, with five training batches that contain 10000 randomly ordered images (for each batch) and one test batch that consists of 10000 images randomly selected from each category. While the training batches include images from all ten classes, each batch might contain a different number of images from each group. Nonetheless, collectively, the training batches contain precisely 5000 images from each category.

B. CUBDL dataset [13]
The CUBDL dataset includes a set of raw Radio Fre- quency (RF) data from different transmission angles that were collected for three different tasks. In this study, 1520 images (corresponding to the task1 of the CUBDL dataset) are reconstructed (a single image was reconstructed for each transmission angle separately). The beamformed images are split into train and test sets with a ratio of 15 percent.
